        <p class="page2">The Internet is very important in the world wide web. It’s basically just a group of computers which send
            information to each other. The History of the internet is not well known we can’t credit to all one person, but
            we do know that it started as a US army funded research project. Then it went on to be a public thing with many
            universities and private companies backing it up. Back then of course this whole idea was brand new and the
            technologies weren’t the best but nowadays it has evolved and has gotten better. But the way everything
            works however didn’t change that much. </p>

        But it doesn’t have to be just 2 computers connected to each other they can be as many as you want but it would be very
        difficult since you’re going to need a lot of cables and plugs. That’s why there’s routers you probably have one at your
        house these are used to sort everything out. When your computers access the internet through your Wi-Fi the router
        makes sure things get to the right computer say there was more than one person using the Wi-Fi saying you are uploading some
        thing to the internet a router makes sure it that your upload gets to the correct computer. But now that we have our
        home net work how can we communicate with others all around the world? We can do that by connecting to our
        telephone infrastructure to do this we have a modem which connects to the telephone infrastructure which then goes to
        your ISP (Internet Service provider). Your ISP has some special routers that can connect to other ISP’s routers. The
        internet consists of this entire infrastructure.

    <p class="main3">
        If you want to send messages to a computer then you have to say which one so that’s why there’s IP addresses (internet
        protocol). All your websites are stored on computers and its hard for humans to remember the IP addresses. That why
        domains have domain names basically like a nickname that’s much easier for us to remember an example would be
        google.com.
