        <p class="p2">The internet can be a very fun and useful place, but not always should you be careless when using it.</p>
           
                <p class="p2" >One of the first anyone can to take to be safer online is by installing some antivirus software. Many people think
            they know how to be safe and do not an antivirus program but what you may think is a safe download may not actually
            a safe download but if you have an antivirus program it will automatically detect it and remove it from your
            computer. To avoid this in the first place just don’t download things from sites that you don’t trust.</p>

                <p class="p2s">Let’s say your just doing your casually web browsing, and shopping and you buy some things you put in your credit
            card information and order it. But what you’ve done is give all your information to hacker, but how could have this
            happened? You were just shopping online at a well know store. This is known as a phishing attack you clicked on a
            link which led you to a fake site that looked just like the real one. Therefore, you should always check the link to
            a site that you feel is suspicious. You must practice safe browsing when on the internet don’t go to sites that
            aren’t safe because hackers have links upon links just waiting for you to click on them. If you can know the
            difference between a legit site and a fake  one that doesn’t mean you safe still because if don’t have strong
            passwords on all your accounts, you can still get hacked easily. Like kaspersky.com advises “A strong password is
            one that is unique and complex—at least 15 characters long, mixing letters, numbers and special characters.”.
